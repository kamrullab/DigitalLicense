## Windows Digital License

The digital license for Windows is tied to the device for a lifetime. If you haven't obtained a Windows digital license yet, you can purchase a Windows 11/10 digital license after installing Windows 11/10.

Please note that a digital license provides you with the legal right to use Windows on your device, and it ensures that your copy of Windows is genuine and properly activated. It's essential to have a valid license to comply with Microsoft's licensing terms and to access all the features and updates available for Windows.

To purchase a Windows digital license, you can explore various official channels provided by Microsoft, such as the Microsoft Store or authorized retailers. Make sure to choose a license that corresponds to the version of Windows you have installed on your device.

Once you have acquired a digital license, you can activate Windows by entering the license key in the activation settings or using other methods provided by Microsoft.

Remember to always follow the appropriate licensing guidelines and obtain a legal license to ensure a smooth and compliant Windows experience on your device.

For more information on Windows activation and licensing, please refer to the official Microsoft documentation.
